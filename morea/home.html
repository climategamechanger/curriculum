<h2 id="welcome-to-climate-game-changer-curriculum-site">Welcome to Climate Game Changer Curriculum Site</h2>

<p>This site is intended to support the development of curriculum materials for the Climate Game Changer course.</p>

<p>For an overview of this project, please see <a href="https://climategamechanger.github.io">https://climategamechanger.github.io</a>.</p>

<p>This site contains four structural elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Modules</em> are the top-level organizational structure for the course. Modules are composed of Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, and Assessments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Outcomes</em> identify what people will know and be able to do if they master the material in a module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Readings</em> represent “passive” learning opportunities, web pages, articles, and videos related to a module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Experiences</em> represent “active” learning opportunities, in which people carry out some action related to a module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Assessments</em> help course designers understand how effective the modules are at: engagement, improving climate change literacy, and creating behavioral change.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the current set of modules, outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments are partial, incomplete, and preliminary.  They are provided just as a catalyst for discussion and improvement.</p>

<p>Also note that this website is intended to support <em>design</em> of the curriculum, not <em>delivery</em>.  We can implement a separate application to actually provide this information to students, develop online quizzes, provide game mechanics, and so forth.</p>
