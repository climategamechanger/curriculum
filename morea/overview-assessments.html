<p>This page collects together all of the “assessments” associated with individual modules.</p>

<p>Assessments should help course designers understand how effective the modules are at:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Engaging people: do they actually look at the module contents?</li>
  <li>Improving their “climate change literacy”: do they achieve module objectives for learning?</li>
  <li>Creating behavioral change: does the module encourage people to do something related to climate change?</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the set of assessments currently in the site do not fulfill these requirements.</p>
