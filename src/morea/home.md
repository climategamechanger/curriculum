## Welcome to Climate Game Changer Curriculum Site

This site is intended to support the development of curriculum materials for the Climate Game Changer course.

For an overview of this project, please see [https://climategamechanger.github.io](https://climategamechanger.github.io).

This site contains four structural elements:

  * *Modules* are the top-level organizational structure for the course. Modules are composed of Outcomes, Readings, Experiences, and Assessments.

  * *Outcomes* identify what people will know and be able to do if they master the material in a module.

  * *Readings* represent "passive" learning opportunities, web pages, articles, and videos related to a module.

  * *Experiences* represent "active" learning opportunities, in which people carry out some action related to a module.

  * *Assessments* help course designers understand how effective the modules are at: engagement, improving climate change literacy, and creating behavioral change.

Note that the current set of modules, outcomes, readings, experiences, and assessments are partial, incomplete, and preliminary.  They are provided just as a catalyst for discussion and improvement.
