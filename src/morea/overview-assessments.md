This page collects together all of the "assessments" associated with individual modules.

Assessments should help course designers understand how effective the modules are at:

  1. Engaging people: do they actually look at the module contents?
  2. Improving their "climate change literacy": do they achieve module objectives for learning?
  3. Creating behavioral change: does the module encourage people to do something related to climate change?

Note that the set of assessments currently in the site do not fulfill these requirements.
