This assessment calculates the percentage of people who have submitted an opinion on how to modify the Aloha+ Challenge dashboard to better account for climate change impacts, and the average number of points.

It can serve as a measure of the degree of understanding of climate change preparations at the societal level and how they could be measured and tracked.
