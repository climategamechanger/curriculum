# Aloha+ Challenge and climate change

The Aloha+ Challenge Dashboard is a way to measure the state's progress toward achieving sustainability goals.

Will achieving these sustainability goals automatically mean that we are "resilient", in the sense that we are prepared for climate change impacts?

If not, what else should be measured? How would you change the dashboard to take climate change issues into account?

Fill out the following form with your answer.  Game administrators will review your answer and award you up to 20 points for your answer, along with feedback about how you can improve your answer if you wish to improve your point total.

You can resubmit your form once a day.
